Run your own data analysis on the “Statlog (German Credit Data) Data Set” @ https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(German+Credit+Data) in a language of your choice (R, python etc).

The German Credit data set contains observations of applicants rated as “good” or “bad” credit. The goal of the exercise is to develop a credit scoring rule that can be used to determine if a new applicant is a good credit risk or a bad credit risk, based on the values of the predictor variables. Some points you can consider in the data analysis part are:

·         Try a machine learning model of your choice to predict bad vs good scores of new customers when asking for a credit
·         Reason about the variables that are more important for the prediction and why
·         Test the chosen model and check that generalizes well to future data
·         Think which external data could be used to enrich the analysis and how it would be used
·         If you would like to go further into a challenging problem on credit data, apply your analytics skills with the scoring data at https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit
